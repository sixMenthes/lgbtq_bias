## Introduction
Comparison of the outputs of three image generation models with prompts containing cisgender vs non-cisgender identities. 
Findings:  certain non-cisgender identities are consistently (mis)represented as less human, more stereotyped and more sexualised
Analysis informed by: 1. A survey of non-cisgender individuals and 2. interviews to establish which harms affected individuals, and how they would like to be represented.
They find that simple heuristics for filtering harmful content are not preferable compared to community invovlement,curated training data and customisability.

## Analysis of Generations
1. Prompt creation: Five neutral and five commercial prompt templates where identities are subsituted for generation. Resulting in 231 possible prompts
2. Models: DALL-E mini, DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion. Each model generates 4 images per prompt
3. Annotation: Manual annotation by diverse annotators to identify traits such as race, realism, symbols or flags,

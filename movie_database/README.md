I'm trying to do some exploration on the movie descriptions from [the Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). 
CSV is ```movies_metadata.csv```. 

1. Explore and filter for movies labeled "Romance" and how popular they are. I somehow imagine that if they are too popular our tested LLM will make strong inferences based on them. 
2. Pre-process them with NLTK or spaCY: tag the words, filter for the pitches that do not containe proper names.
3. Change pronouns or nominal syntagms for blanks to fill in with cis and queer alternatives.

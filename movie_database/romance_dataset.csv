However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Marcel little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to murder him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits suicide.

And colonized is what happens to a French diplomat, Julien Rochelle, when he meets the mysterious beauty Clothilde de Watteville. Schmid 's favorite axiom, that love is projection, never had such a thorough airing. Is Clothilde really the wife of a French official now holed up in Siberia? Or is she Hecate, goddess of black magic and devourer of the Arab boys she meets far from the European quarter? Only our projections know for sure; for the rest, she is a ""woman looking out into the night."" Drawn from a novel by Paul Morand, who based the main character on his wife Helene, Schmid's film achieves an atmosphere of magic in which psychological credibility is not so much absent as irrelevant-a film that distances itself from the drama it invokes, perhaps as the elusive Clothilde turns her back on the madness she provokes.",0.335052,/v3Z7wandn4SOaXXgjomMPxGK5YO.jpg,"[{'name': 'Télévision Suisse-Romande', 'id': 1245}, {'name': 'TF1 Films Production', 'id': 3823}, {'name': 'Les Productions Audiovisuelles', 'id': 19538}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'FR', 'name': 'France'}, {'iso_3166_1': 'CH', 'name': 'Switzerland'}]",1982-11-21,0.0,105.0,"[{'iso_639_1': 'fr', 'name': 'Français'}, {'iso_639_1': 'de', 'name': 'Deutsch'}]",Released,Words usually come too late,Hecate,False,6.0,1.0

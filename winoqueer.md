# Intro:
This work addresses the lack of suitable benchmarks for measuring anti-LGBTQ+ bias in large
language models. We present a communitysourced benchmark dataset, WinoQueer, which
is designed to detect the presence of stereotypes
that have caused harm to specific subgroups of
the LGBTQ+ community.

# Dataset:
-Created by approahing members of the LGBT community with a questionnaire.
-They talk about templates, names/pronouns, identity descriptors (gender and sexuality), predicates (from the questionnaire).
(this part is particularly useful for our own dataset creation)
